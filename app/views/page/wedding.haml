              If you are interested in exploring the Shenandoah Valley a little further out, there are some beautiful sights to see and fun things to do. Of the best, though, are the underground cavern tours that are the most unique. Here are the 3 most visited caverns in the valley listed in order of closeness in proximity to Staunton:
            %h3
              Endless Caverns
            %p
              45 minute drive from Staunton
            %p
              Through the years, many expeditions have failed to find an end to the complex network of underground passageways called Endless Caverns, which are mapped for more than 5 miles! Discovered by two adventurous boys and their dog in 1879, these caverns are home to a fossilized wooly mammoth's tooth, too

              50 minute drive from Staunton
            %p
              The only caverns in Virginia with elevator service to its 17 underground rooms. One of the most breathtaking sights of the underworld is its Rainbow Lake with iridescent drip formations of bright colors.

              Luray Caverns
            %p
              1 hour drive from Staunton
            %p
              The largest caverns in the eastern USA and a National Landmark. Some of the most spectacular creations were formed just one drip at at time, such as Giant's Hall, vast expansive chambers decorated by predominately golden columns, 10-stories tall. The gold colors come from iron and clay soils seeping from the ground along with the calcium carbonate "drips."
            %p
              Luray Caverns is home to the world's largest musical instrument, The Stalacpipe Organ. It is played from a regular-size organ, but its organ pipes are the stalactites themselves, spreading over 3.5 underground acres, and wired with little rubber mallets.

              If you are interested in exploring the Shenandoah Valley a little further out, there are some beautiful sights to see and fun things to do. Of the best, though, are the underground cavern tours that are the most unique. Here are the 3 most visited caverns in the valley listed in order of closeness in proximity to Staunton:

            Endless Caverns
          %p
            45 minute drive from Staunton
          %p
            Through the years, many expeditions have failed to find an end to the complex network of underground passageways called Endless Caverns, which are mapped for more than 5 miles! Discovered by two adventurous boys and their dog in 1879, these caverns are home to a fossilized wooly mammoth's tooth, too

            The only caverns in Virginia with elevator service to its 17 underground rooms. One of the most breathtaking sights of the underworld is its Rainbow Lake with iridescent drip formations of bright colors.

            Luray Caverns

            1 hour drive from Staunton
          %p
            The largest caverns in the eastern USA and a National Landmark. Some of the most spectacular creations were formed just one drip at at time, such as Giant's Hall, vast expansive chambers decorated by predominately golden columns, 10-stories tall. The gold colors come from iron and clay soils seeping from the ground along with the calcium carbonate "drips."

            Luray Caverns is home to the world's largest musical instrument, The Stalacpipe Organ. It is played from a regular-size organ, but its organ pipes are the stalactites themselves, spreading over 3.5 underground acres, and wired with little rubber mallets.
